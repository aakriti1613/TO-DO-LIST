# TO-DO-LIST
**Overview**
This project is a fully functional and responsive To-Do List website built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, FontAwesome, and Popper.js. The website allows users to manage their tasks efficiently, with features such as task categorization (ongoing, delayed, and completed tasks), task addition through a modal, and local storage for data persistence across browser sessions. The project focuses on providing a simple, clean, and intuitive user interface that works seamlessly across different devices.

**Features**
1. Task Management System: Add, delete, edit, and categorize tasks into ongoing, delayed, and completed.
2. Responsive Design: The website adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using Bootstrap.
3. Local Storage: Tasks are stored in the browserâ€™s local storage in JSON format, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
4. Interactive UI: Add tasks through a modal form, dynamically update the task list, and view tasks based on their status.
5. Task Sections: Navigate through different task categories (ongoing, delayed, and completed) via the navbar.
6. FontAwesome Integration: Icons used for better visual representation and user interaction.
7. Modal for Adding Tasks: Add new tasks through a modal interface to keep the main task table clean and organized.
